# Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate - Front-End Developer Capstone | Portfolio-Project

## Description

For the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate - Front-End Developer Capstone | Portfolio-Project, I created a complete, responsive website from scratch, focusing on both the design and technical functionality. Starting with Figma, I designed a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate layout that captures the brand’s personality and invites users to explore.

Once the design was set, I built the structure using HTML and styled it with CSS to bring the layout to life. I used React to make the site responsive and interactive. I connected an API for table reservation.
